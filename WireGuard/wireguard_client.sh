# This script will add a new peer to your router Wireguard
# server and present the conf file and QR code.
# Copy/paste/import the conf file settings, or use the WG
# mobile app to scan the QR code.
# It keeps track of used IP addresses and provides a new,
# unused IP for each peer created.

# variables - update the variables below to match your
# WireGuard config before you run the script


# path - where you want the script to store files it creates
# Each run creates a .conf and .peer file for that peer.
path=/home/admin/wireguard/clients
# router public key
routerpubkey= #Enter Your PublicKey#
# router WireGuard IP (up to third octet)
routerip=10.1.16
# DNS
dns=1.1.1.1
# Endpoint - router ext ip/hostname/dydns
endpoint=#wireguard.yourdomain.com
# port
port=51820
# allowed ips
allowedips=0.0.0.0/0


# After saving the script, make sure to make it executable:
# sudo chmod +x <path><scriptname>


# Now create a text file for the script to manage IP address.
# Create the text file in the path you set in the variables above.
# Name the file: nextip.txt.
# The file should contain only the value for the last octet
# of the next peer IP, i.e., the "x" in 192.168.33.x.
# E.g., if your current highest peer IP is set 192.168.33.4, the
# nextip.txt file should have the number 5 in it.
# chmod the file so it is editable by the script:
# e.g., sudo chmod 777 <path>nextip.txt.


# The script uses the nextip.txt file to assign the allowed IP to
# each peer you create. The script increments the value in
# the nextip.txt file each time it is run (e.g., from 5 to 6), so that
# you get a fresh unused IP address for each peer.


# ====================================
# Usage: <scriptname> <filename>


# Each time you run the script, two files are created in
# the path you set in the variables above:
# 1) <filename>.conf; and 2: <filename>.peer


# Use the .conf file for copy/paste/import if you aren't
# scanning the QR code from a mobile app
